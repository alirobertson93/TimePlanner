# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-24

## Introduction

Welcome to TimePlanner ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally

TimePlanner is designed with a **privacy-first, offline-first architecture**. All your data is stored locally on your device:

- **Events and Calendar Data**: Event titles, descriptions, times, locations, and associated metadata
- **Categories**: Custom category names and colors you create
- **Goals**: Goal titles, targets, progress tracking, and associated categories/people
- **People**: Contact names and optional contact information you add
- **Locations**: Location names and addresses you save
- **Preferences**: App settings including theme preferences, notification preferences, and scheduling defaults

**This data never leaves your device** unless you explicitly export it or use cloud sync features (if available in future versions).

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do NOT collect personal identification information
- We do NOT track your location
- We do NOT collect analytics about how you use the app
- We do NOT sell or share your data with third parties
- We do NOT use advertising or ad tracking

### Notifications

If you enable notifications, the App uses your device's local notification system to remind you of events. Notification data is processed entirely on your device.

## How We Use Your Information

Since all data is stored locally, your information is used solely to:

1. Display your events, goals, and schedule within the App
2. Generate intelligent schedule suggestions using our scheduling algorithms
3. Send local notifications for event reminders (if enabled)
4. Personalize your App experience based on your settings

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

All data is stored in a SQLite database on your device. This data is:

- Protected by your device's security (passcode, biometrics)
- Not accessible to other apps
- Not transmitted over the internet

### Data Backup

Your TimePlanner data may be included in your device's backup:

- **iOS**: If you use iCloud backup
- **Android**: If you use Google backup

These backups are governed by Apple's or Google's privacy policies respectively.

## Third-Party Services

TimePlanner does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

Future versions may offer optional integrations (e.g., calendar sync). Any such integrations will require your explicit consent and will be clearly disclosed.

## Children's Privacy

TimePlanner is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Your Data Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data:

### Access and Export
- View all your data directly within the App
- Export your data using the App's export features (if available)

### Modification
- Edit or update any data through the App's user interface

### Deletion
- Delete individual events, goals, people, or locations
- Uninstalling the App removes all associated data from your device
- Use your device's settings to clear app data

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Posting the new Privacy Policy within the App
- Updating the "Last Updated" date

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

## Data Retention

Your data is retained on your device until:

- You delete it within the App
- You uninstall the App
- You clear the App's data through your device settings

We do not retain any data on external servers.
