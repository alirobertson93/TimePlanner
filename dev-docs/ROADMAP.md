## Code Quality Audit Findings (2026-01-24)

A comprehensive codebase audit was performed. Full report available at `dev-docs/AUDIT_REPORT_2026-01-24.md`.

### Overall Assessment: **Good** ✅

### Key Strengths
- Pure Dart scheduler enables thorough testing (7ms for 100 events vs 5s target)
- Comprehensive documentation suite (15+ dev-docs)
- Strong repository and scheduler test coverage
- Proper database indexing (10 indexes in schema v11)
- Clean architecture properly implemented

### Areas Requiring Attention

**High Priority**:
- Widget test coverage (only 3 of ~10 screens tested, target 60%+ per TESTING.md)
- Error handling standardization (28 catch blocks with inconsistent patterns)

**Medium Priority**:
- Router duplication (`router.dart` has legacy static router + provider-based)
- TODOs in production code (2 remaining: work hours config)

**Low Priority**:
- Outdated documentation (IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Recurrence exception handling (feature gap)
- Travel time in schedule generation (feature gap)

### Recommended Actions
1. ~~Link Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in Settings screen (App Store requirement)~~ ✅ **DONE**
2. Archive/update IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md and BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md
3. Expand widget test coverage
4. Implement centralized error handling service
5. Remove router duplication

---

## Next Development Session Guide

**Prerequisites** (requires Flutter SDK):
1. Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
2. Run `flutter test` to verify test suite (145+ tests)

**Phase 8 Remaining Work**:

1. **Keyboard Navigation** (requires Flutter SDK)
   - Add focus nodes to interactive elements
   - Implement tab order for forms
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

2. **App Store Assets** (requires design tools + Flutter)

## Notes

### Development Velocity
- Phase 1: ~1 session (documentation)
- Phase 2: ~1 session (core implementation)
- Estimated: 2-3 sessions per phase going forward

### Key Decisions
- 15-minute time slots as atomic unit
- Pure Dart scheduler (no Flutter dependencies)
- Repository pattern for data layer
- Offline-first architecture
- Clean architecture with strict layer separation

### Success Criteria
Before considering the project "complete":
- [ ] All 8 phases finished
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for business logic ✅ (repositories/scheduler)
- [ ] Widget test coverage >60% (currently 30% - audit finding)
- [ ] All critical user flows working end-to-end
- [ ] Performance targets met (schedule generation <2s) ✅ (7ms for 100 events)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 AA) ✅ (screen reader + color contrast)
- [ ] Legal documents linked in app (audit finding)
- [ ] Beta testing with 10+ users
